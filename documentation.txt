/**
 * File Exports
 * Every folder should always have an index file which exports
 * all the files contained within that same folder

 * /pages/index.tsx
 * /features/index.tsx
 * /components/{another folder}/index.tsx
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------EXAMPLE
 * In the event that the folder needs more files than the index file
 * you can name the file in such a way that it identifies what that
 * file actually does using the naming convention specified in this
 * documentation

/**
 * Business Logic Description
 * Every page with some element of business logic must be tightly detailed

 * // Definition of what function is meant to accomplish and why you are
 * initializing it
 * e.g const allowButtonToCloseModal = () => //do some code here
